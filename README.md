# COOOOOOMMMMBAAAAAT!

"Combat" is a simple turn-based fighting game, inspired by an [Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/academy/) assignment. 

It's meant to be said "CooooOOOoooMMM-BAT!". All funny like that, with lots of OOOooooOOO'ing. Wild gesticulations encouraged. All rights reserved. If ithcing or burning persists, please see a doctor immediately. The End.
